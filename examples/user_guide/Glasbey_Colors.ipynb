    "Colorcet originally included only continuous color spaces, but it was created while working on [Datashader](http://datashader.org), which uses both continuous and categorical sets of colors.  For rendering categorical data, Datashader requires having a distinct color per category, and it includes some ad-hoc collections of colors to try to get enough distinct colors to deal with complex datasets.  \n",

    "\"Glasbey\" colors are available in [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/Glasbey) and for [R](https://github.com/btupper/catecolors), and there is a [Python implementation](https://github.com/taketwo/glasbey) of the method.  Generating the colors with the Python code is time consuming, so we generated some large sets of Glasbey colors and distribute them in colorcet."

    "The code requires some starting set of colors, which by default is just white. Using the default, the second color is always very dark, which doesn't make for a very recognizable first color to choose for plotting. By adding both white and black as the starting colors, the initial colors in the subsequent sequence seem more useful, in that they are actually nameable colors. All glasbey cmaps included in colorcet are initialized with black and white. In addition - some also include the named categorical colormaps such as Category10 and Category20 used in [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/palettes.html#bokeh.palettes.d3) and originally from [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Ordinal-Scales.md#categorical-colors).
