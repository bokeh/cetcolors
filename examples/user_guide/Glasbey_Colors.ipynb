    "## Colormaps for Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Colorcet primarily includes continuous colormaps, where each color is meant to be equally spaced in perceptual color space from the preceding and following colors. But for categorical data, it is important for each color to be visibly distinct from the other colors, _not_ nearby in color space, to make each category separately visible. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are [many sets of categorical colors available](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/3682), but these tend to be relatively small numbers of colors.  To support visualizing large numbers of categories, it would be good if an arbitrarily large number of colors could be chosen in a principled way from an available color space. Glasbey et al. presented such a method in:\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a starting palette (e.g. white, black), this approach selects each new color to be maximally perceptually dissimilar from all the preceding colors, out of an allowed color space. Glasbey colors are available in [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/Glasbey) and for [R](https://github.com/btupper/catecolors), and there is a [Python implementation](https://github.com/taketwo/glasbey) of the method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating the colors from Python is time consuming, so we have generated some specific large sets of Glasbey colors to distribute in colorcet, as outlined below. We'll use [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) with [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org) for displaying these colormaps so that you can zoom in for a closer look."
